    <ul> 
        <li> Conditional Breakpoint
            <code> b test.cpp:199
                   cond 1 denom == 0
            </code>
        <li> Execute Commands (ie printing) at breakpoint
            <code> command N
                   print i
                   print j
                   end
            </code>
            where N is the breakpoint number you want to issue commands at.
